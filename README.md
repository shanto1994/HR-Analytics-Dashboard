Power BI project to visualize total attrition, average working hours, attriton by salary, education, job role etc so we can know why people are quiting job and how it can be prevented.

2. Added new column from Atrrition change its values to numeric values (yes to 1 and else 0) and 
named it AttritionCount and make it's data type number.

Visualization :

average monthly income.

3. Added 1 stacked column chart to know Attrition by Age.
4. Added a matrix to show how satistied ex employees were based on their job role.

job and take action on them.

Some sample questions we are able to answer :

2. After working how many years people leave job mostly?
3. Will increasing of salary solve the problem?
